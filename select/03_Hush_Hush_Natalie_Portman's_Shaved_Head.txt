She is a dangerous outlaw
(She's got the boys all makin' noise)
She's hot, but she's a liar
(She's got the boys like little toys)

Hush, hush girl, you talk too much
Whoa, whoa keep it on the down low
(X2)

There's a trail of hearts broken
(She's got the boys all makin' noise)
Grapes on her vine are poison
(She's got the boys like little toys)

Hush, hush girl, you talk too much
Whoa, whoa keep it on the down low
(X2)

High school sucks
High school sucks

She is a dangerous outlaw
She's hot, but she's a liar
There's a trail of hearts broken
Grapes on her vine are made of poison

Hush, hush girl, you talk too much
Whoa, whoa keep it on the down low
(X6)
