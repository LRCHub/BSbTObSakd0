Long white arms
Losing their strength and form
Sixty year man on twenty year old skin
Skeleton, your eyes have lost their warmth
Look to your father for some support

Hush, hush, hush
Says your daddy's touch
Sleep, sleep, sleep
Says the hundredth sheep
Peace, peace, peace
May you go in peace

Cruel joke you waited so long to show
The one that you wanted wasn't a girl
All your life you kept it hidden inside
Now when you step
You stumble
You die

Hush, hush, hush
Says your daddy's touch
Sleep, sleep, sleep
Says the hundredth sheep
Peace, peace, peace
May you go in peace

Oh, maybe next time
You'll be Henry the 8th
Wake up tomorrow, Alexander The Great
Open your eyes in a new life again
Oh, maybe next time you'll be given a chance

Hush, hush, hush
Hush, hush, hush
Hush, hush, hush
Hush, hush, hush
(Hush, hush, hush)
(Hush, hush, hush)
