I Never Needed You To Be Strong
I Never Needed You For Pointing Out My Wrongs
I Never Needed Pain I Never Needed Strain
My Love For You Was Strong Enough
You Should Have Known

I Never Needed You For Judgement
I Never Needed You To Question What I Spent
I Never Ask For Help
I Take Care Of Myself
I Don't Know Why
You Think You've Got A Hold On Me

And It's A Little Late For Conversations
There Isn't Anything For You To Say
And My Eye's Hurt Hand's Shiver
So Look At Me And Listen To Me

Because

I Don't Want To Stay Another Minute
I Don't Want You To Say A Single Word
Hush Hush Hush Hush
I've Already Spoken Our Love Is Broken
Baby Hush Hush

I Never Needed Your Corrections
On Everything From How I Act To What I Say
I Never Needed Words
I Never Needed Hurts
I Never Needed You To Be There Everyday

I'm Sorry For The Way I Let Go
From Everything I Wanted When You Came Along
And My Eye's Hurt Hand's Shiver
So You Will Listen When I Say

Baby

I Don't Want To
Stay Another Minute
I Don't Want You
To Say A Single Word
Hush Hush Hush Hush
I've Already Spoken Our Love Is Broken
Baby Hush Hush
First I Was Afraid I Was Petrified
Kept Thinking I Could Never Live Without You By My Side
But I Spent So Many Nights
Thinking How You Did Me Wrong
But I Grew Strong
I Learnt How To Carry On

Hush Hush Hush Hush
I Have Already Spoken
Our Love Is Broken
Baby Hush Hush
Oh no, not I
I will survive
Oh as long as I know how to love
I know I feel alive
I've got all my life to live
I've got all my love to give
I will survive

I WILL SURVIVE

Hush Hush Hush Hush
There Is No Other Way
I Get The Final Say
I Don't Want To Do This Any Longer
I Don't Want You There's Nothing Left To Say
Hush Hush Hush Hush
I've Already Spoken Our Love Is Broken
Baby Hush Hush
